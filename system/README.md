This is an installation from a forked version of the official CodeIgniter 3 project.

This forked project adds support for PHP 8.2 to CodeIgniter 3.

## Note:
There is a pull request (PR) in the official CodeIgniter 3 repository to add support for PHP 8.2, but it has not yet been merged.

We will be monitoring this PR and will switch back to using the official source code once it is merged.
